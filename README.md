# Evaluating the performance of different matrix types

This checks the performance of different matrix types for row/column access.
To run the tests on your machine, follow these instructions.

1. Install [_beachmat_](https://github.com/LTLA/beachmat).
This requires [_Rhdf5lib_](https://github.com/grimbough/Rhdf5lib) and _Rcpp_.
2. Enter `simulations` and execute all R scripts.
This may take some time and will generate timings (in milliseconds) for matrix access in a range of scenarios.
